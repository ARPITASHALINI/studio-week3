# Welcome to the Studio Week 3!
So far, we've learned how to set up web pages and embed some pre-existing maps, and then create new base maps with basic markders. This week we'll be working to add more interactivity to our maps.  

### A few notes on these tutorials
1. Similar to last week, you will need to look for comment code in these files to guide you. As a refresher, `<! -- Comments in HTML that look like this -->` and comments in Javascript `// use two slashes like this.`
2. If needed... 


## Expected Outputs for this week / what to submit: 
Add text here about what needs to submitted: files, links to maps, hosted sites, etc. 

### We Need to Pick 3-4 of the options below: 
All three of the exercises below **require them to create an `index.html` file that they would write from scratch.** Should give them starter code or have them build them from scratch? Might be nice to follow the week 2 example and have a small, 3-page site, composed of a few pages with bare-bones html to start. What do you think? I've also listed alternatives to the numbered exercises. I'm really open to any combination of these. 
1. Start with [this Mapbox tutorial for creating a style for a choropleth map](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/). Once you've completed that, move on to [this tutorial that will show you how to add interactivity to your map](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/).
> **Alternatively** there's [this Leaflet tutorial on creating an interactive choropleth map](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) that is about the same as the mapbox one above. This same tutorial was [replicated here with a bit more detail](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/lectures/lec09) (or so it seems). And there is this [Leaflet tutorial for adding basic geographic features (point, polygon, polyline) to a map](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/lectures/lec07), which might be better to start with? 
2. Next, head on over to [this Mapbox tutorial for analyzing point data](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/analysis-with-turf/) and complete it. 
3. Finally, create a custom web page that includes a map. You can style your page anyway you like (e.g. using HTML, CSS, Jekyll, etc.) but you shoudl try to use colors and fonts that work with your map. Regarding the map: pick some data, choose your technology (Leaflet or Mapbox), and design a custom map. The map can use a custom or stock basemap, but should contain at least 10 points, polygons, or lines that are styled and include a popup. Use this as an opportunity to try out different ideas for your final project: if your team reuses this code, or builds on top of it, that's fine! 
> **Alternatively** there's [this mapbox code with me html file that contains prompts to add functionality](https://github.com/mapbox/web-mapping-curriculum/blob/master/class-3/in-class-exercises/cwm-interactions.html). The [solutions file for this can be found here](https://github.com/mapbox/web-mapping-curriculum/blob/master/class-3/in-class-exercises/solutions/cwm-interactions-solution.html). We could use this instead of designing a custom map... or have them pick one of their previous maps and add these new functions to it. Another option might be this great rat map tutorial ([tutorial here](http://maptimeboston.github.io/leaflet-intro/) and [repo here](https://github.com/maptimeBoston/leaflet-intro)) that's quite easy to follow but covers a lot (basic geographic features, styling, basic interactivity), which I really like. However, I couldn't get it to load when [I hosted it on Github](https://github.com/Shadrock/first-leaflet-map). 

**At the end of the week you will submit a link to your repo via Moodle.** Happy coding!

## For those who need a bigger challenge. 
After successfully following the instructions above you can take things further... these tutorials are more complex but allow for some really cool interactivity. They both require you to construct complete web pages. 
- [Build a Store Locator](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/building-a-store-locator/)
- [Show changes over time](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/show-changes-over-time/): this tutorial includes a 4MB GeoJSON file that contains 15,273 geocoded motor vehicle collision incidents in NYC. Because Github pages limits are 1GB, you should be able to host these data and the code in a repo!
