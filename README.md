# Welcome to the Studio Week 3!
So far, we've learned how to set up web pages and embed some pre-existing maps, and then create new base maps with basic markders. This week we'll be working to add more interactivity to our maps.  

### A few notes on these tutorials
1. Similar to last week, you will need to look for comment code in these files to guide you. As a refresher, `<! -- Comments in HTML that look like this -->` and comments in Javascript `// use two slashes like this.`
2. If needed... 


## Expected Outputs for this week / what to submit: 
Add text here about what needs to submitted: files, links to maps, hosted sites, etc. 

### Options for creating interactive choropleths
- **Requires an `index.html` file that they would write from scratch. Should give them a starter?**
Start with [this Mapbox tutorial for creating a style for a choropleth map](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/). Once you've completed that, move on to [this tutorial that will show you how to add interactivity to your map](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-2/).
> **Alternatively** there's [this Leaflet tutorial on creating an interactive choropleth map](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) that is about the same as the mapbox one above. This same tutorial was [replicated here with a bit more detail](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/lectures/lec09) (or so it seems). 

- **Also requires an `index.html` file (could be named differently) that they would write from scratch. Should give them a starter?** 
Next, head on over to [this Mapbox tutorial for analyzing point data](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/analysis-with-turf/) and complete it.   

**At the end of the week you will submit a link to your repo via Moodle.** Happy coding!

## Additional Resources. 
After successfully following the instructions above you can take things further... these tutorials are more complex but allow for some really cool interactivity. They both require you to construct complete web pages. 
- [Build a Store Locator](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/building-a-store-locator/)
- [Show changes over time](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/show-changes-over-time/): this tutorial includes a 4MB GeoJSON file contains 15,273 geocoded motor vehicle collision incidents in NYC.
